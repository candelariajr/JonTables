My Attempt at a Filter/Sort/JSON/AJAX/Responsive Table Minimalist Plugin


Dissatisified at the large quantites of bloat and lack of features of most data-table like plugins out there, I set out to make my own for a few upcoming (privately-owned) webapps.

Phase 1: Filter
Phase 2: Sort
Phase 3: Responsive
Phase 4: JSON Construction
Phase 5: AJAX/AJAJ Construction/Live Link
Phase 6: Config/Plugins
Phase 7: D3 Link
Phase 8: Real-Time Analytics
Phase 9: Indexing and ORM
Phase 10: Cache loading with my SQL/Mongo -> JSON plugins for PHP
Phase 11: Redux of AJAX/AJAJ live link with web socketing because 2006 has been over for quite some time, plz.

The phases are all complete with 1000+ lines of JS laying about in 200 files on my servers....the trick is going to be organizing and getting them all together....and making them all play nicely. 
Remember, if it's not N or N(logN) time, then it's outta here!
